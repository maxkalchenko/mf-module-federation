# mf-module-federation
This project demonstrates how to implement micro frontends using Webpack 5â€™s Module Federation feature. We have two React applications, App1 and App2, which are set up as independent micro frontends. App1 acts as the host application, while App2 provides a remote component that is loaded dynamically into App1
